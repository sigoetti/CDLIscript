# CDLIscript

A very well commented script to read data out of the [CDLI cuneiform database](https://cdli.ucla.edu/). To use, search for what you are looking for (in this case we looked for "Uruk"), then download the source code of the results page (right mouse click -> download source code) which has up to 2000 results and let the script run over it. 

The output is in CSV, using the fields Title, Type, Provenience, Period,Transliteration. If the search result is several pages long, download each page seperately and combine the resulting CSV files using copy&paste.
